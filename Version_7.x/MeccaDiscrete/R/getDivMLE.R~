		## There is a warning in this function. The rbounds arg should be tweaked in order to be certain that you found the optimum. The help suggests to begin search for narrow window of bounds and then slowing increasing. Can be a problem that the function cannot be evaluated at some range, for example. Could this bring some problem to the estimation of the MLE?
		## There is also a issue with the combined arg. When it is FALSE then the internal phylogeny is not contributed to the likelihood. The lambda MLE is calculated only based in the stem clades. When it is TRUE the backbone of the tree is also used.
		lik[i] <- fit$LH
		div[i] <- fit$r
		lam[i] <- fit$lambda
		## Those are vectors with length = 199. Each value is the MLE for the parameter under one of the 199 values of ext (extinction factor).
