There is a series of functions that are taking too much time to run. Here I will try to make them, and, as a result, the whole process run faster. 
Below is a list of the function that have already been viewed. Folliwing will be any kind of commentaries and descriptions of modifications.

acceptance.R
Could be acc if there is a way to generate normal densities in C (dnorm). There is a for() loop in the function.

addMissingTaxa.R
There is a block, begining in line 31 [tipDiversity<-sort(tipDiversity)] and ending in line 

calibrateDiscreteABC
