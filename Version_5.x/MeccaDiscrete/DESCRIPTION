Depends: TreeSim, pls, laser, Rcpp
Description: Changed the 'simBranchingDiscrete.R' function to work with the 'noTreeSim.R' and not with the C code. Copied a 'backup_simBranchingDiscrete.R' file in the 'cd ..' folder. The C code is out of the package. Seem to be everything ok. But the first test showed a empty result of 'runDiscreteMECCA.R'. -- Added one line on the NAMESPACE file. Adding C codes to make the calculations faster: getProposal.R |
