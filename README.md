MECCA discrete
========

This is an extension of the MECCA R package produced by Graham Slater (Slater, G. J., L. J. Harmon, D. Wegmann, P. Joyce, L. J. Revell and M. E. Alfaro. 2012. Fitting models of continuous trait evolution to incompletely sampled comparative data using approximate Bayesian computation. Evolution 66:752â€“62.) and available in his website: https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/gradstudents/slater/Graham/Graham_J_Slater.html

The MECCA discrete use Aproximate Bayesian Computation to infer rate of speciation (lambda), extinction (mu) and the transitions rates of two states of a binary character (Markov model: q12 <-> q21). This method can be applied to sparsely sampled trees.

The method is unstable at the moment and the C code need show errors in compilation. I am saving diferent versions of the package.
